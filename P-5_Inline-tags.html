Inline tags are tags used within a line of texts, for instance,
in words of a paragraph, to give emphasis to that word. Inline
tags can make the text bold or cursive, for example.

<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="P-5_Styles.css">
    <!-- This is a link to an external .css file, which we will see
    later how to use. The file has formatting instruction used below-->
  </head>

  <body>
    <p> This is a <em>cool</em> <strong>example</strong> </p>
    <!-- The <em> tag emphasize the word with italics -->

    <p> Another example, <span class="style1"> now with a span</span> </p>
    <!-- The span tag is used to format a section of the text, with
    specifications contained in a separate .css file. Here, the class
    "style1" is called, but its definition is in the .css file -->
